# Cataclysm: DDA Map Editor

This project is intended to create a simple, but powerful map editor to enable quick content creation for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

It is currently in alpha development. More information will be added soon.

Uses JavaFX 8.

Copy a few files from your Cataclysm game directory to "Sample Data/" in the following configuration to run this:
```
Sample Data/
	tileset/
		fallback.png
		tile_config.json
		tiles.png
		tileset.txt
	ags_terrain.json
	furniture.json
	terrain.json
```

I'll add some real configuration to this soon so that it can be built and run without having to copy files elsewhere alongside some real build instructions. Hang tight.
